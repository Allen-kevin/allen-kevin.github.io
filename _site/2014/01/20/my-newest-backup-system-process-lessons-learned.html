<p>With all my bellyaching about Backblaze lately, it only stands to reason that I should pick a better system.</p>

<p>So, following <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComputerBackupRuleOfThree.aspx">Scott Hanselman’s advice</a>, I’m upping my backup game. Below is how I plan to take care of my ~400 GB of data so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Taking care of the data normally:</strong> My data will be on two 2TB hard drives in a RAID1 configuration. It uses Intel RST, which is a great app that lets me use an SSD drive as a cache. If your components support it, I can’t recommend it enough.</li>
  <li><strong>An extra local copy:</strong> I have two additional 1TB harddrives (from my last RAID set). I’ll be setting up Robocopy on a scheduled task to mirror files in certain folders, and will also set it up to monitor folders when files change.</li>
  <li><strong>An additional off-site copy:</strong> Since I have two 1 TB hard drives, I will label them “A” and “B” and swap them when I go to see my family in Pennsylvania. If I didn’t have family in another state, a bank safety deposit box would do just fine.</li>
  <li><strong>An external hard drive</strong>: Because seriously, why not? This way I know it can travel, too. No backup is too much, even just for convenience, especially if I can automate it.</li>
  <li><strong>GMail:</strong> My e-mail is also precious. I’ll be again using <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AutomaticallyBackupYourGmailAccountOnAScheduleWithGMVaultAndWindowsTaskScheduler.aspx">a Hanselman-authored solution</a> to back this up.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud Backup:</strong> If Backblaze is able to take care of me, I may keep them because I have a lot invested. Otherwise, I’ll be looking at other options. But the point is, this should be the last of my concerns after all the other ones are taken care of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking forward to getting this set up ASAP.&lt;/div&gt;</p>
