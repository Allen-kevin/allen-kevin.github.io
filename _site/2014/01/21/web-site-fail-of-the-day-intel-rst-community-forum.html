<p>The Intel RST Community Forum is a tough club to get into!</p>

<p>First, I try to login and LastPass helpfully fills in my saved information which I’ve used previously.  However, it appears it no longer works:</p>

<p>No worry, I’ll reset my password:</p>

<p>…just kidding. No e-mail ever arrives. Maybe I forgot to create my account:</p>

<p>And the kicker: Maybe I’m getting my username wrong and I can have them e-mail it to me…</p>

<p>Not really sure what else I can legitimately do to try to get into this web site..</p>

<p>Bonus! I found out that the Intel &amp; Intel Communities logins are different. OK, could have been my bad. I see the button to link the accounts:</p>

<p>I previously just created an intel account to get around this mess, so this seems like the perfect solution! I click “login with my Intel account” and…</p>

<p>…I give up. Intel is just trolling me at this point.</p>
