<p>This one’s mostly for my quick personal reference. It wasn’t hard by any means but figured someone else might find it useful.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>I need to find all hex color codes in a style sheet so I can extract them.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>I came up with a quick Regex (regular expression) to do this:</p>

<pre><code>#([A-Fa-f0-9]*);
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, it just looks for a pound symbol (<code>#</code>), followed by any amount of numbers 0-9 or letters a-f, followed by a semi-colon.</p>

<p>If you’re interested to try it, you can view <a href="">my example over at Regex Tester</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not the slickest but it got the job done quickly.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
