<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>After upgrading to Windows 8.1 Pro recently, I opened my Event Log to show a <strong><em>TON</em></strong> of errors from WMI. Event showed as an error and had the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Event filter with query “SELECT * FROM __InstanceOperationEvent WITHIN 10 WHERE (TargetInstance ISA ‘Msvm_ExternalEthernetPort’) OR (TargetInstance ISA ‘Msvm_VmLANEndpoint’) OR (TargetInstance ISA ‘Msvm_SyntheticEthernetPort’) OR (TargetInstance ISA ‘Msvm_ComputerSystem’) OR (TargetInstance ISA ‘Msvm_VLANEndpointSettingData’)” could not be reactivated in namespace “//./root/virtualization” because of error 0x80041010. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>I did a little searching around and <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4eca1f42-8630-48b4-85fa-e9569445d832/problem-with-cpu-load-and-wmi-errors-when-hyperv-is-installed">found this link</a> which suggested removing the network adapter and installing 8.1’s default network adapter.</p>

<p>However, I decided to see if an update to the latest drivers would do the trick.</p>

<p>I have the P8Z68 V/Pro motherboard (which I love), which comes with an Intel 82579V card. I hopped over to the <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx?lang=eng">Intel Download Center</a> and found the Windows 8.1 Network Adapter Driver v18.7 (<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/confirm.aspx?httpDown=http://downloadmirror.intel.com/23071/eng/PROWinx64.exe&amp;lang=eng&amp;Dwnldid=23071&amp;DownloadType=Drivers&amp;OSFullname=Windows+8*">direct link here</a>).</p>

<p>Sure enough, installing the updated version of the adapter was enough – no need to replace it with the generic Windows 8.1 adapter. The errors have stopped and I’m seeing a performance gain as well. </p>

<p>If you were experiencing the same issue, I hope this helps! Feel free to let me know how you fared in the comments.</p>
