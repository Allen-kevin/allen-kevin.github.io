<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>I was writing a Microsoft Word document and making use of cross-references, when I realized that upon changing the text/title of my cross reference, the links to that reference would not update their text. This led to me having to right-click each reference and choose “Update”.</p>

<p>That was not going to fly.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>A quick Google revealed the solution to me:</p>

<p><code>F9</code> is the magic key in Word to update cross-references, so selecting the entire document (via <code>CTRL + A</code>) and then pressing <code>F9</code> gets the job done.</p>
