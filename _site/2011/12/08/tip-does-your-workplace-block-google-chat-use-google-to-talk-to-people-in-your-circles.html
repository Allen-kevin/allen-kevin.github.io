<p>While circumventing your workplace’s chat policy is never necessarily a wise thing, if your office place blocks Google Chat, you can (partially) circumvent this to allow Google Chat with folks in your Google+ circles.</p>

<p>To do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sign into Google+.</li>
  <li>On the <code>home</code> tab, you should see a notification about being able to chat with your circles.</li>
  <li>Click <code>OK</code>, and your contacts will appear on the home screen with standard gchat-like indicators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things of note so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your friends’ job titles take the place of chat statuses within Google+ chat</li>
</ul>
