<p>A brief anecdote:</p>

<p>I prepared a presentation yesterday to present today to colleagues on subjects such as Continuous Integration, Unit / Spec Testing, Source management, etc.</p>

<p>I created the presentation in MS PowerPoint 2010, and saved it with some embedded fonts in .pptx format. It runs great. I open it on my work PC this morning, and it runs great. I save it to a thumb drive, and it opens fine.</p>

<p>We get into the conference room late, I log onto the PC that’s there, I open the presentation..
…<em>and PowerPoint crashes</em>.</p>

<p>I try copying it from the USB Drive to the Desktop, I open it …<em>and PowerPoint crashes again</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Luckily,</strong> I saved a version in .ppt format so that it would be backwards compatible with PowerPoint 2000-2003. I open that …<em>and PowerPoint crashes again</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Luckily,</strong> I also uploaded the presentation to SlideShare. I attempt to open that …<em>and the computer has trouble connecting to the internet.</em></p>

<p><strong>Luckily,</strong> I had also exported the presentation to a PDF file. I open that in Adobe Acrobat Reader, put it in full-screen mode, <strong>and gave the presentation</strong>.</p>

<p>I hope that illustrates the point well enough without further explanation.</p>
