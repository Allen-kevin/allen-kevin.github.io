<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>I accidentally deleted the group name text from a section of my Crystal Report in Crystal Reports 2008, and now I would like to re-insert the text.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>This is embarrassingly simple, and yet I found it to be surprisingly counter-intuitive. Maybe it’s just me..</p>

<p>In the <code>Field Explorer</code> section, expand the <code>Group Name Fields</code> section and drag the name onto the report.</p>

<p>It’s not under insert, not as a menu shortcut, etc. – as far as I can tell, the only place to drag a Group Name field from is there.</p>
