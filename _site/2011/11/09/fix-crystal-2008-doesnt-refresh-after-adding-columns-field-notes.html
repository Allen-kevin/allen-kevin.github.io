<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Crystal Reports 2008 Designer does not reflect changes made to views or stored procedures, even after refreshing the database and those views/procedures within Crystal.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>While a horrible user experience, there is a proper method to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Based on trips from <a href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/programming-life/adding-new-fields-to-stored-procedure-and-updating-it-in-crystal-reports-30072">this helpful article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <code>Database</code> menu, click <code>Verify Database</code>.</li>
  <li>If dealing with a stored procedure, you will be asked to enter parameters; enter correct ones.</li>
  <li>Crystal Reports will undergo a verification process, during which time it will find the extra fields and adjust the report accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>No idea why this is separate from (and ambiguously named compared to) a right-click and “refresh”, but it does the job.</p>
