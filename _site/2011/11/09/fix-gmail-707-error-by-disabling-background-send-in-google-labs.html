<p>For anyone who has had an issue with a GMail 707 error in the browser recently, a <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/11/gmail-707-error.html">potentially useful tip</a> via Brad Feld over at <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/">FeldThoughts</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer was a simple one once I figured it out. I disabled all the Google Labs and it magically started working again. I then re-enabled Labs until I found the one that was causing the 707 error – the “Background Send” Labs. Apparently something broke over the weekend with Background Send and the newest browser version of Gmail.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are getting a 707 error, just turn off Background Send. That should fix it.</p>

<p>Thought it might be useful to some.</p>
