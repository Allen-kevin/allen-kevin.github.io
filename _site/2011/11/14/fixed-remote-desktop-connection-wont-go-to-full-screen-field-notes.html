<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>In Windows 7, I am in a Remote Desktop Connection Full screen. I accidentally pop it down to “window” size (i.e. when it can be resized), but the window refuses to go back into Full Screen mode.
###Solution
On the host machine (not the machine you’re remoted into), press <code>CTRL+ALT+Break</code> (or <code>CTRL+ALT+Pause</code> for laptops that don’t have a Break key).</p>

<p>On laptops, there may be an extra step. For example, on my laptop, this combination was <code>CTRL+ALT+Fn+Insert</code> (<code>Insert</code> doubles as the <code>Pause</code> key on my machine, and <code>Fn</code> is the button to toggle the alternate meaning).</p>

<p>With the right combination of keys, this places Remote Desktop back into full-screen mode.</p>
