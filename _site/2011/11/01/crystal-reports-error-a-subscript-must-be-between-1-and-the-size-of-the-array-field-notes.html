<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>A long-standing Crystal Report (being run out of SAP Business Objects XI v12) suddenly started generating an error along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in File [File Name]: Error in formula [Formula Name]: ‘left(split({[Field Name]},”/”)[2],3)’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A subscript must be between 1 and the size of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Details: errorKind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The bracketed values were specific to the report itself)
###Solution</p>

<p>In this case, the formula is looking for a <code>/</code> to split the string. On a hunch, I decided to query the database, and sure enough, some of the fields in the database had been modified and no long included a <code>/</code>, causing the formula to bomb out.</p>

<h4 id="two-solutions-here">Two solutions here:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If the <code>/</code> is a business requirement and is supposed to be there, modify the data.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, modify the formula to include branching logic that takes other steps if a <code>/</code> is not detected.</li>
</ul>
