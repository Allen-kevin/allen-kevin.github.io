	<div class="post"><p>Dressed up nicely today for a big meeting with the head of our division at work.</p>

<p>A coworker needed a spoon, and I used it as an excuse to indulge my inner caffeine addict in the cafeteria.</p>

<p>5 minutes after I bought the coffee, it splashed against the side of the container and formed a nice little geyser to land on my light-colored shirt.</p>

<p>Normally, I would have been doomed to a day of embarrassment at a time when I really don&#39;t need any. <strong>Luckily, this is where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037KMI0K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0037KMI0K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seankilcom-20">Tide to Go</a> comes in.</strong></p>

<p>I keep a TTG pen in my office for just such an occasion. I walked quickly back to my office and used it on a gigantic area of my shirt. It took a few minutes (it was a seriously large area to cover), but was painless.</p>

<p>The end result? By the time I delivered the spoon to my coworker, she couldn&#39;t notice any stain.</p>

<p>This product is sheer brilliance. I&#39;m buying 2 more today.</p>
