				<h1>Tip: Always Write Out Your SQL Queries in Plain English First [Field Notes]</h1>

<div class="content">
	<div class="post"><p>I recently ran into an issue where <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8070694/query-help-totaling-parent-child-items/8081369#8081369">constructing a SQL query took me <strong><em>much</em></strong> longer than I would have liked</a>. While my need to dust off some cobwebs and my lack of familiarity with an enterprise system certainly contributed, I think the biggest factor was that -- because I didn&#39;t write out what I wanted to accomplish in plain English -- I was attempting to think about my data in the way that the database was thinking.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the difference between just talking about what you want to return and how you will go about doing it. I believe you should do both, but separately, and they should inform each other.</p>

<h4>Example: What You Want To Return</h4>

<ul>
<li>Summaries for the costs and labor of a work order&#39;s child tasks (which are just a special type of work order having the original work order as a parent and a designation of a task)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example: What Your Process Will Be To Get it</h4>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ll get the hours summary, labor cost summary, and item cost summary by task workorder number, by joining the workorder number across workorder, labor, and items

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ll Constrain this by making sure the work order is a task</li>
<li>I&#39;ll call this Work Order Summary</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once I have that working, I&#39;ll put it on the inside of another set of summaries, by parent so that I can sum up the summaries and have them for each parent work order.</li>
<li>Once that works, I&#39;ll make sure that all potential null values (summaries) return zero if they come back null.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested Key Phrases&lt;</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;I&#39;ll call this... &quot;</strong> --  Helps you to decide what your Aliases / &quot;As&quot; statements should be</li>
<li><strong>&quot;I&#39;ll get the...&quot;</strong> -- Indicator of types of field information you want to return in each record</li>
<li><strong>&quot;I&#39;ll constrain this by making sure&quot;</strong> -- helps define your WHERE clause</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Summary&quot;</strong> -- helpful to see if you&#39;ll be aggregating / grouping</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Once that works, ...&quot;</strong> -- Helps you to see a testing point, or a place that can stop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Benefits</h3>

<p>Consider the other practical benefits that writing your queries in plain English will bring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly -- you lose nothing by doing this. That&#39;s the biggest thing.</li>
<li>You&#39;ll find what I call your &quot;test points&quot; -- places where you can stop and insert some hard code for the purposes of testing.</li>
<li>If you can&#39;t write it out using plain language, you will be informed early on that you don&#39;t understand the data you&#39;re dealing with.</li>
<li>You can always start over from scratch if the query design doesn&#39;t quite work, knowing that you won&#39;t lose what you were trying to do.</li>
<li>You can ask for help much more easily if you need it, and help your rescuers understand your situation quickly and clearly</li>
<li>It automatically self-documents the business language, which means that someone smart on the business side can read it and tell you if you&#39;re not understanding the business rules quite right. This can be very helpful if your queries aren&#39;t returning what the end-user needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone know where I might find more guides along these lines? Do you have suggestions or improvements? Sound off in the comments!</p>
