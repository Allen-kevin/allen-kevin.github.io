<p>This is the desktop, assembled, without the enhanced airflow in the rear and with <em>no overclocking yet.</em></p>

<h4 id="windows-experience-score-out-of-79">Windows Experience Score (out of 7.9)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Processor:</strong> 7.8 </li>
  <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> 7.8</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 7.7</li>
  <li><strong>Gaming Graphics:</strong> 7.7</li>
  <li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 6.0 (I think the SSD caching hasn’t fully kicked in yet)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PCMark 7 Score</strong>: low 4,000 (~4,100? Forgot the actual number)</p>

<p><strong>Standard Temperature</strong>: ~89F (hottest of the 5 temp sensors)</p>

<p><strong>Gaming Temp</strong>: ~93F (tested with Call of Duty: Black Ops)</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The “overclockening” – when I feel like it. It runs smooth like butter now and I have no reason to push it (this is going to be part server, after all)</li>
  <li>Increasing the air flow</li>
  <li>Ensuring everything is backed up (Backblaze is chugging along now)</li>
  <li>Moving media/content from External HDD onto Desktop</li>
  <li>Erasing External HDD</li>
  <li>Configuring Windows System backup on HDD</li>
  <li>Virtualization, and tons of it. Setting up a bunch of systems (more posts on why later)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="also-a-big-thank-you">Also, a Big Thank You</h3>
<p>Thanks to John Herron, a former co-worker and excellent techie, I also now have a 20” LCD monitor. The kindness of nerds astounds.</p>

<p>Any ideas for other benchmarks? Let me know!</p>
