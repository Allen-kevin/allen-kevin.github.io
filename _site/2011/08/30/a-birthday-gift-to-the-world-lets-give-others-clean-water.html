<p>I’m a lucky guy, and I’ve had by all standards a great and fantastic 25 years so far. I’ve got most things I could want in life, and everything I need.</p>

<p>I wish it was the case everywhere, but it’s not; the fact of the matter is, some on this Earth still lack the basic necessities for survival. Every once in a while, I’ll dump some of a glass of water down the sink, and I’ll remember that in some places it’s still considered a precious commodity.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be that way.</p>

<p>And so, I’m giving up birthday gifts again this year to try to make a difference. With your help, I was able to raise $281 last year, and I’d like to see if we can top it this year.</p>

<p>Please consider donating at <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/seans25th">http://mycharitywater.org/seans25th</a>  for my 25th birthday. I’ll appreciate it, but the people who will have clean water to drink will appreciate it even more.</p>

<p><a href="http://mycharitywater.org">Charity:Water</a> is one of the most accountable, transparent organizations I’ve ever seen, and I hope you’ll add your charity as we work to help the world.</p>
