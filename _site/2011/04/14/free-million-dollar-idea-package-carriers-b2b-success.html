	<div class="post"><p>I&#39;ll try to keep this post brief or see if I can sketch it out in bullet-points.</p>

<h3>My Current Situation</h3>

<p>Like many people:</p>

<ul>
<li>I live in an apartment</li>
<li>I work during the day</li>
<li>I often work different or longer hours than standard business hours 

<ul>
<li>i.e. before 9am and after 6pm)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My work often requires my physical presence / prevents me from leaving to get a package</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Beef I Have With Package Carriers</h3>

<ul>
<li>They force you to sign for packages.</li>
<li>Sometimes, after you sign, they say they still can&#39;t deliver.</li>
<li>All apartments are considered unsafe by default it seems.</li>
<li>Carriers don&#39;t trust your authorization to drop the package, even when expressly written and signed.</li>
<li>Carriers don&#39;t stagger their delivery times 

<ul>
<li>i.e. if they try before 10:30am on Monday, they&#39;ll try before then on Tuesday and Wednesday too. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Business Problem</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily all the carrier&#39;s fault; they have things they need to abide by as well.</p>

<p>The business problem, as I see it, involves the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Carriers have SLAs</strong> with their shipping partners (guaranteed dates/times of delivery, etc.). This can be very helpful sometimes (i.e. every package will arrive next day by 10:30). However, if the customer is not available at that time, the SLA can actually hamper delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Carriers have a responsibility</strong> for goods (so they don&#39;t want to leave them in &quot;dangerous&quot; areas)</li>
<li>Customers need to pick up packages in a way that <strong>works with their schedule</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>How I Think They Could Fix it</h3>

<p>I think that package carriers are missing an important opportunity here -- the ability to partner with other businesses to help customers receive their package.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about a scenario like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customers can specify an intermediary business for delivery. Think national chain businesses that are open outside of 9-5 hours. Lots of restaurants (McDonalds, Subway), box stores (Walmart, Costco, etc.), and grocery stores (Giant, Acme) fall into this category.</li>
<li>Customers either could pay a fee to use this intermediary or the carrier could offer it as an option, and could select the intermediary. This is especially of benefit if a customer wants to group purchases, e.g. &quot;I&#39;ll pick up my package and get groceries!&quot;</li>
<li>Businesses create space for a holding area for packages and accept the responsibility of an intermediate carrier (i.e. responsible for lost/damaged packages, etc.). Businesses will protect this because it&#39;s linked to their business reputation and customers chose them for a reason. They have a stake in quality.</li>
<li>Carriers drop off a consolidated shipment according to their SLAs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits to All Parties</h3>

<h4>Businesses</h4>

<ul>
<li>Businesses receive some cash (either from carriers or from the fee to hold the package there)</li>
<li>But more importantly, businesses also receive a chance at customer purchases while they&#39;re there. Impulse buys, combining purchasing ideas, etc. For example, if I could pick up a package and my groceries from Whole Foods and not at giant, guess who&#39;s getting my grocery dollars.</li>
<li>Stronger relationship with a national carrier driving business to the store.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Shippers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Less logistical concerns -- they drop the packages off at businesses, businesses handle from there.</li>
<li>Could be a good corporate partnership -- think of a store devoting some space to a UPS kiosk, for example. Branding in visible places.</li>
<li>Could actually save money -- less trucks, less driving, less re-delivering packages, less info notice slips, and most importantly, less logistical overhead in returning to sender.</li>
<li>Stronger relationship with stores -- customers more likely to choose you if you offer shipment to businesses they frequent.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Customers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pick up packages when it&#39;s convenient to do so.</li>
<li>Huge convenience gain; knock errands out in one shot.</li>
<li>Know that your package will be delivered (businesses are open + they have an agreement)</li>
<li>You&#39;re notified when a shipment is delivered, so you know you can pick it up.</li>
<li>Knowing the business will be open outside of standard 9-5 business hours; you don&#39;t have to be frustrated simply because you have a job, and you don&#39;t have to negotiate a break to sit and wait for a package.&lt;</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do you think?</h3>

<p>So, could this ever work? What would you change about it? Sound off in the comments; I&#39;d love to discuss!</p>
