<p>I’ll try to keep this post brief or see if I can sketch it out in bullet-points.</p>

<h3 id="my-current-situation">My Current Situation</h3>
<p>Like many people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I live in an apartment</li>
  <li>I work during the day</li>
  <li>I often work different or longer hours than standard business hours </li>
  <li>i.e. before 9am and after 6pm)</li>
  <li>My work often requires my physical presence / prevents me from leaving to get a package</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-beef-i-have-with-package-carriers">The Beef I Have With Package Carriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They force you to sign for packages.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, after you sign, they say they still can’t deliver.</li>
  <li>All apartments are considered unsafe by default it seems.</li>
  <li>Carriers don’t trust your authorization to drop the package, even when expressly written and signed.</li>
  <li>Carriers don’t stagger their delivery times </li>
  <li>i.e. if they try before 10:30am on Monday, they’ll try before then on Tuesday and Wednesday too. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-business-problem">The Business Problem</h3>
<p>This isn’t necessarily all the carrier’s fault; they have things they need to abide by as well.</p>

<p>The business problem, as I see it, involves the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Carriers have SLAs</strong> with their shipping partners (guaranteed dates/times of delivery, etc.). This can be very helpful sometimes (i.e. every package will arrive next day by 10:30). However, if the customer is not available at that time, the SLA can actually hamper delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Carriers have a responsibility</strong> for goods (so they don’t want to leave them in “dangerous” areas)</li>
  <li>Customers need to pick up packages in a way that <strong>works with their schedule</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-i-think-they-could-fix-it">How I Think They Could Fix it</h3>
<p>I think that package carriers are missing an important opportunity here – the ability to partner with other businesses to help customers receive their package.</p>

<p>Let’s think about a scenario like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customers can specify an intermediary business for delivery. Think national chain businesses that are open outside of 9-5 hours. Lots of restaurants (McDonalds, Subway), box stores (Walmart, Costco, etc.), and grocery stores (Giant, Acme) fall into this category.</li>
  <li>Customers either could pay a fee to use this intermediary or the carrier could offer it as an option, and could select the intermediary. This is especially of benefit if a customer wants to group purchases, e.g. “I’ll pick up my package and get groceries!”</li>
  <li>Businesses create space for a holding area for packages and accept the responsibility of an intermediate carrier (i.e. responsible for lost/damaged packages, etc.). Businesses will protect this because it’s linked to their business reputation and customers chose them for a reason. They have a stake in quality.</li>
  <li>Carriers drop off a consolidated shipment according to their SLAs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benefits-to-all-parties">Benefits to All Parties</h3>
<p>####Businesses
* Businesses receive some cash (either from carriers or from the fee to hold the package there)
* But more importantly, businesses also receive a chance at customer purchases while they’re there. Impulse buys, combining purchasing ideas, etc. For example, if I could pick up a package and my groceries from Whole Foods and not at giant, guess who’s getting my grocery dollars.
* Stronger relationship with a national carrier driving business to the store.</p>

<h4 id="shippers">Shippers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Less logistical concerns – they drop the packages off at businesses, businesses handle from there.</li>
  <li>Could be a good corporate partnership – think of a store devoting some space to a UPS kiosk, for example. Branding in visible places.</li>
  <li>Could actually save money – less trucks, less driving, less re-delivering packages, less info notice slips, and most importantly, less logistical overhead in returning to sender.</li>
  <li>Stronger relationship with stores – customers more likely to choose you if you offer shipment to businesses they frequent.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="customers">Customers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pick up packages when it’s convenient to do so.</li>
  <li>Huge convenience gain; knock errands out in one shot.</li>
  <li>Know that your package will be delivered (businesses are open + they have an agreement)</li>
  <li>You’re notified when a shipment is delivered, so you know you can pick it up.</li>
  <li>Knowing the business will be open outside of standard 9-5 business hours; you don’t have to be frustrated simply because you have a job, and you don’t have to negotiate a break to sit and wait for a package.&lt;</li>
</ul>

<p>So, could this ever work? What would you change about it? Sound off in the comments; I’d love to discuss!</p>
