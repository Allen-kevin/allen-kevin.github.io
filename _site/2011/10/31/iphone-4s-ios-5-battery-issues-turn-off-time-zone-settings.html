<p>The <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5854653/iphone-4s-battery-problems-may-be-a-bug-with-ios-location-services">excellent folks over at Lifehacker have a tip</a> that seemingly works to resolve iPhone 4S and iOS 5 battery level issues.</p>

<p>The culprit? It looks to be a bug in the Time Zone settings that causes location services to go nuts and poll way more often than it needs to, draining the battery.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>To remedy the issue, according to Lifehacker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solution for now seems to be manually switching off the automatic time zone updates located at Settings → Location Services -&gt; scroll to bottom to System Services → Setting Time Zone. Expect more conclusive results in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve tried it and saw an immediate and striking difference in battery life. Give it a shot if you haven’t yet. And if you’re jet-setting anytime soon, just re-enable it (or take me with you and I’ll do it for you!)</p>
