&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;Seriously?&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>Dear Charles Schwab,</p>

<p>It is 2011. Why do you have a <strong>maximum</strong> length of 8 characters on an account password? And why is the only requirement that there be a number between letters?</p>

<p>It does not inspire confidence when I am about to ask you to hold my money.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It also <em>doesn’t allow symbols</em>. That’s right, folks; maximum of 8 characters, and only letters/numbers. I can’t believe this crap.</p>
