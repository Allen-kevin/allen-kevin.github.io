<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>This year, for my 24th birthday, I wanted to do something different. Inspired by Chris Sacca and the Charity: Water project, I want to try to donate $500 by September 30th, which I hope will be easily accomplished.</p>

<p>Please donate here: <a href="http://www.mycharitywater.org/Seans24thBirthday0">Charity: Water – Sean’s 24th Birthday</a></p>

<p>I’ll appreciate it, but the 25 people (5 families) with clean drinking water will appreciate it the most. I’ve donated $5 to my own campaign to prove that I’m willing to put my money where my birthday-cake-eating mouth is.</p>

<p>I’m lucky as hell to be where I am, and hope those who know me will help support me in helping others.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
