<p>This one’s not exactly under-documented, but I wanted to post here as a reference and in the hopes that someone else might have to not dig around.
###The Problem
Our client needed to take a webapp down for maintenance (re-organization across the institution) and needed to block access to Tomcat for all users except the specific administrators performing the re-organization). </p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>Use Tomcat to block all connections with the exception of administrator IP Addresses (which were static to us and known). </p>

<h3 id="the-steps">The Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open the context.xml file, located in [Tomcat<sup>1</sup>]confcontext.xml.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’ve never edited this file before, you should see a line like the following:</p>

    <pre><code>  &lt;WatchedResource&gt;WEB-INF/web.xml&lt;/WatchedResource&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the following line directly after the &lt;/WatchedResource&gt; tag:</p>

    <pre><code>  &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="IP1|IP2|IP3"&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>…where IP1, IP2, IP3, etc. are the IP addresses you would like to allow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Restart the Tomcat server.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes-on-how-it-works">Notes on How it Works</h3>
<p>This valve uses regular expressions, so if you decided to get fancy with it, you certainly could (provided you know a little about Java Regular Expressions). For our purposes, the pipe (“|”) character in-between the IP addresses works as an “or” operator. If the Remote Address Value matches any of these full strings, it is allowed. </p>

<p>Note that by default, this denies every other connection. </p>

<p>If you’d like to allow all connections except certain IP addresses, you can change the “allow” attribute to “deny”; all connections will be allowed except those in the deny attribute, which still uses Java regular expressions. </p>

<p>To my knowledge, this “valve” structure can’t be stacked. That is to say, you can’t do a “deny all” valve and then stack multiple types of “allow valves” on top of it. If anyone knows if this is possible, feel free to sound off in the comments. </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
