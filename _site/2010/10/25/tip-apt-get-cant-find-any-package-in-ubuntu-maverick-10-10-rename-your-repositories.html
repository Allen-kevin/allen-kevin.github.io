<p>It appears that the shipped version of Ubuntu Maverick 10.10 (at least the server version) comes with repository  server URLs that are incorrect – or at least non-functioning. I discovered this the hard way after much trial, error, and self-doubt. I hope the masses benefit from my suffering. :)</p>

<h3 id="the-symptoms">The symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Can connect to the network</li>
  <li>Can run “sudo apt-get update”</li>
  <li>Can run “sudo apt-get upgrade”</li>
  <li>Cannot run “sudo apt-get install [package name]” for ANY package.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open nano to edit the file:
&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list</p>
  </li>
  <li>Edit all “http://us.archive.ubuntu.com” to “http://archive.ubuntu.com”</li>
  <li>Uncomment all the lines that start with “deb” or “deb-src” (if you know what you’re doing). <strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that the text starts the line (i.e. don’t leave a space – bad practice).</li>
  <li>
    <p>CTRL + X, Y to allow overwrite, enter to save to the current file name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update packages:
&gt; sudo apt-get update</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upgrade:
&gt; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>
  </li>
  <li>Badda-bing, it works!</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure if this is an ongoing or temporary issue, but hopefully this will be fixed by the team in time one way or another.</p>
