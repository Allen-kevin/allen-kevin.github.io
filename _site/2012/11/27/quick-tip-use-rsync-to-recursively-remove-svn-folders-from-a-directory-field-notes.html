<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>I have a directory structure that contains Subversion metadata folders (folders named “.svn”).</p>

<p>I would like to remove those folders but “svn export” won’t work.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>Rsync to the rescue. Let’s say the folder containing .svn folder structures is named “problemfolder”. Do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the same directory as the problem folder, create a “clean” folder to output the contents of problemfolder to eventually.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
"mkdir problemfolder_clean"
</code>
* Run rsync, excluding .svn folders and their contents, to copy the problem directory to the clean directory.</p>

<p><code>
rsync -avr --exclude='.svn*' /path/to/problemfolder/ path/to/problemfolder_clean
</code></p>

<p>At this point, the contents of “problemfolder” (minus the .svn folders) will be in the clean folder you created.</p>
