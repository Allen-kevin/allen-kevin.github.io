<p>Just a quick tip – one of the things I used to be frustrated with in Outlook was the difficulty to simply send a message to a number of people on an event. Scheduled outages, etc. were difficult to update folks on.</p>

<p>Outlook 2010 has made this much easier with the addition of a “Contact Attendees” button to the event. Look for it on the ribbon for the event. Screenshot below:</p>

<p>Hope you find it useful!</p>
