<p>As part of my job, I have to send a lot of e-mail communications to users. I like them to be as standard and repeatable as possible.</p>

<p>I hadn’t set up a system to do this at my new place, so I thought I’d post here now that I’m up and running.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>We need a standard, repeatable, and easy way to respond to users’ requests.
###My Solution
<em>[Yes, I know this is not the most high-tech solution.]</em></p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-system">Setting Up the System</h4>

<ol>
  <li>For each type of request, create an excel spreadsheet (or a sheet within an Excel Spreadsheet) with the information you need to complete that request and respond to the user. One of the fields should always be “E-Mail” since you’ll use this later.</li>
  <li>Create a MS Word document for the response to the user. Write it like you would an e-mail.</li>
  <li>Use MS Word Mail Merge functionality to connect to the spreadsheet and insert placeholders for data.</li>
  <li>Save the Word Document and Spreadsheet in an accessible place. Preferably, keep them in the same directory (multiple docs and one Excel workbook with multiple sheets works nicely for me).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="using-the-system">Using the System</h4>
<ol>
  <li>User submits request(s) – you make sure you have all the proper information to complete the request(s). You put it in your spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Complete the tasks at hand.</li>
  <li>Preview the Mail Merge and make sure it looks okay.</li>
  <li>Under <code>Finish and Merge</code> in MS Word, select <code>Send E-Mail Messages..</code> </li>
  <li>Select the field that contains the e-mail address to send it to, enter your subject, and then send it to all records.</li>
  <li><strong>Important:</strong> Delete the entries in the spreadsheet, or it will send to them each time. (I may rig up a field in the spreadsheet for “archived” so that it won’t send if that field is filled, but it’s too advanced for what I need at the moment.)</li>
</ol>
