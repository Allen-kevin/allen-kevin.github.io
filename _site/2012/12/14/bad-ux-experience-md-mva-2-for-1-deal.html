	<div class="post"><p>I know this comes as a shock to nobody, but MD&#39;s don&#39;t-call-it-the-DMV &quot;Motor Vehicle Association&quot; isn&#39;t the easiest to get around.</p>

<p>However, this one was a little puzzling.</p>

<h3>Bad UX Example</h3>

<p>While attempting to fill out a change of address form on the web site, the new address is given only one line (no &quot;street 2&quot;) address. And to make matters worse, the <strong>address is limited to only 30 characters.</strong> So, if you have a long street name and/or live in an apartment, this field will be a joy for you to fill out.</p>

<p>Even better: Since I had to get creative with the symbols in the name, I shortened the &quot;BLVD&quot; in my new street address to &quot;BVD&quot; (only way I could still fit the apartment in). It then tried to get me to accept the USPS standardized version, which either cut the apartment number&#39;s 3rd digit off, or cut out the &quot;BLVD&quot; portion entirely.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had to force it to use the original, so now it will read &quot;BVD&quot;, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a matter of time before I&#39;ll have to get that corrected.</p>

<h3>Additional Bad UX Example</h3>

<p>While writing this blog post, I attempted to link to the change of address form, so I right-clicked on the link titled &quot;change of address form&quot; and chose to copy the URL. When I pasted it just now, I got:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">javascript:__doPostBack(&#39;ctl00$btnChangeOfAddress&#39;,&#39;&#39;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Really? We&#39;re still doing postbacks on buttons this way? I guess the best way to avoid link rot is to make sure your link is never a link in the first place.</p>

<h3>What can we as Developers Learn From This?</h3>

<p>There are already great posts on falsehoods programmers believe about <a href="">names</a>, <a href="">time</a>, <a href="">networks</a>, <a href="">geography</a>, <a href="">build systems</a> -- It seems like one on addresses is long overdue. In the spirit of those posts, I&#39;ll begin one below based on my experience.</p>

<h4>In the context of addresses, all of the following are wrong:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The street address will be less than 30 characters</li>
<li>The location will have a house number</li>
<li>The city will be less than 30 characters</li>
<li>The USPS address standardization will always be correct</li>
</ul>
