	<div class="post"><p>&quot;Who am I in the midst of all this thought traffic?&quot; -Rumi</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to take a social media hiatus for the month of January (at least). There are about a billion reasons for this, but I wanted to catalog them here in case I forget or I want to reverse course.</p>

<h3>Why I&#39;m Doing This</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been losing focus on things that matter. I want to create. I want to think about bigger ideas. I want to do some long-form reading for a change. I realized something was wrong recently when I couldn&#39;t focus on a long-form blog post I was reading because I had the urge to check Twitter -- while I was walking from one office to another during work. It&#39;s time for a change. I need to become a citizen of the real world again.</p>

<h3>The Social Media Outlets I&#39;m Currently Using</h3>

<p>So, what will I be giving up?
The list is extensive when I lay it all out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Google + </li>
<li>Google Reader</li>
<li>App.me</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>FellowUp</li>
<li>Timehop</li>
<li>Foursquare</li>
<li>IFTTT (disabling my social recipes)</li>
<li>Path</li>
<li>Sonar</li>
<li>Undrip</li>
<li>Bonus: computer games</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll allow myself e-mail, but only as a tool to reach out when necessary or to reconnect with friends. While using it, I&#39;ll be unsubscribing from everything possible so I can stop the deluge of e-mail I get. I&#39;ll also allow myself to write, and may actually start putting some personal thoughts out there somewhere (this blog has always been largely technical.)</p>

<h3>What I hope to Achieve</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better Sleep</strong>. I was constantly browsing social media and Google Reader before sleep, which would be fine, except I had to read *all *of it. I&#39;m hoping this will let me turn off the screen before bed and get some solid sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Better Focus</strong>. I want to do some deep thinking on projects &amp; problems. I want to free up space for my mind to fill in with ideas, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Better Memory</strong>. Due to the nature of my brain jumping around all the time I think, my memory has become terrible due to transient information constantly bombarding it. I want to do some exercises and see if I can&#39;t improve my memory.</li>
<li><strong>Better Friendship</strong>. My friendship skills have seriously an inexcusably fallen off. Social media doesn&#39;t equate with being social. I need to get out in the world again and say hello instead of typing it.</li>
<li><strong>Better Performance at Work</strong>. I get a lot done at work, but I&#39;m excited to see what can happen when I&#39;m not pulling away during every spare minute of downtime to catch up on the social media world.</li>
<li><strong>More Deep Learning</strong>. Even over this holiday, I&#39;ve found that I&#39;m able to focus on tutorials and technical reading much better, because there&#39;s not the promise of some tweet to keep me occupied every other minute.</li>
<li><strong>Read an actual book</strong>. Seriously, I can&#39;t remember the last time I finished an actual paper book.</li>
<li><strong>Stepping back from the Political scene</strong>. I&#39;m way involved, and I&#39;m letting others&#39; opinions pass for my own when I agree with them. That&#39;s not good enough. I want to see if I can dig deep and attempt to solve some problems in a comprehensive way, and I want to put something out there that others can challenge and build upon or critique. Hiding behind the opinions of others doesn&#39;t cut it.</li>
<li><strong>Switching from &quot;Consume&quot; to &quot;Produce&quot; mode</strong>. I have ideas I want to build, but the state of mind for building and consuming are distinctly different, I&#39;ve found, and it&#39;s not easy to switch from one to the other (at least not for me).</li>
<li><strong>Separating Signal from Noise</strong>. I hope that stepping back will help remind me what&#39;s important and what I actually miss about social media, which will help me learn to more wisely consume it in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I&#39;m Preparing &amp; Cutting Myself Off</h3>

<p>My brother accepted the challenge to barricade me from Social media, so I&#39;m giving him the keys to the kingdom. I&#39;ll be doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analyzing social media, the e-mails I&#39;ve received, and apps I have linked to Facebook/Twitter. This is my detox list.</li>
<li>Disabling the connections to all third-party apps that could ping me in those accounts.</li>
<li>Stopping any e-mail alerts from these sites.</li>
<li>Removing these apps from my phone.</li>
<li>Having my brother change the passwords for each of those accounts in front of me.</li>
<li>Utilizing a blocker -- in every web browser on every computer -- to completely block all of the aforementioned web sites.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Self-sabotage</strong>. I&#39;m crafty, and while I think I can stay away, I&#39;m sure it will be tempting to try to open something. If you see me on social media somehow in January, yell at me. Like, a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</strong>. Apparently this is a real thing, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll experience some of it, but I&#39;m hoping that it won&#39;t materialize.</li>
</ul>
