<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I use LESS instead of CSS in my ASP.NET MVC app.</li>
  <li>I would like it to actually work.
###Solution
There are two steps (that I know of) to fixing this problem. The first is to make sure that your build package will actually output the LESS files in the first place; the second is to ensure that IIS can serve them.
####Step 1: Ensuring that the Build Package outputs LESS files</li>
  <li>In your solution, highlight all your LESS files</li>
  <li>Right-click and select properties or look in the properties window.</li>
  <li>Set the <code>Build Action</code> property to <code>Content</code>. This will ensure that the raw content is outputted from those files during build instead of another build action.</li>
  <li>Set the <code>Copy to Output Directory</code> property to <code>Copy Always</code>. This ensures that your LESS files will actually make it into the package folder that MSBuild outputs.</li>
</ul>
