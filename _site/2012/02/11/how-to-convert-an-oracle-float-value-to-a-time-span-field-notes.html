<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>We have a bunch of “durations” stored in Oracle as <code>FLOAT</code> datatypes (as day intervals, meaning they are an interval that includes days).</p>

<p>This makes sense. from a database storage perspective. However, I didn’t know how to get those values into the more human-comprehensible hh:mm:ss format.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>An Oracle function called <code>NUMTODSINTERVAL</code> is exactly what we need here. As the name suggests, it converts a number to a DateStamp interval (which is to say, interprets a number as a time span). We can tell it the type of time span (days in this case), and then extract the appropriate time values.</p>

<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>NUMTODSINTERVAL ([yourvalue], '[typeofinterval]')</code></p>

<p><strong>Basic Example:</strong> <code>NUMTODSINTERVAL (tablename.durationfield, 'DAY')</code></p>

<p>The above example takes my field named ‘durationfield’ and tells oracle it’s a DAY interval. From here, we use the <code>EXTRACT</code> function to get what we want.</p>

<h3 id="solution-examples">Solution Examples</h3>
<p>####Gets the number of hours (and converts all day values to 24 hours each):</p>

<p><code>SQL
EXTRACT(DAY FROM NUMTODSINTERVAL(TABLENAME.DURATIONFIELD, 'DAY')) * 24
+ EXTRACT(HOUR FROM NUMTODSINTERVAL( TABLENAME.DURATIONFIELD , 'DAY')) 
AS DURATIONHOURS
</code></p>
