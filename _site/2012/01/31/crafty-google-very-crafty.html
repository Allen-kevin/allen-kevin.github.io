	<div class="post"><p>A quick observation: on most social networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) you&#39;ll see the option to connect with folks that you know.</p>

<p>Google+ applies this intuitive concept, but with a twist to its own benefit.</p>

<p>On the right-hand side of the Google+ home page, I noticed the option to add folks, and (wrongly) made the quick assumption that these folks are already on the network, despite the fact that some buttons are instead labeled &quot;Add and Invite&quot;. Picture below:</p>

<p><img src="http://skwordpresstoghost.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-01-31_ss_GPlus_AddAndInvite.png" alt="Add and Invite Buttons"></p>

<p>Notice the difference? You might not at first glance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the end of the world or anything, but if G+ just duped me into inviting 10+ people unwittingly, it likely has gotten <em>many</em> more sign-ups this way.</p>

<p>A subtly shady tactic on Google&#39;s part. They might argue that they&#39;ve streamlined the process, but to me, inviting someone actively to a social network (i.e. telling them they should join) is a much different vibe than adding them if they are already on the network.</p>

<p>I just made this mistake with a few former co-workers and friends I haven&#39;t connected with in a while (sorry if you got a weird invite, all!), so I wanted to make note of the design difference.</p>

<p>Makes me appreciate all the more that sites like LinkedIn make it clear with an icon who is a member and who isn&#39;t yet.</p>
