	<div class="post"><p><em>**Ed. Note:</em>* This is one of those weird public-disclosure blog posts. If you only come here for tech stuff, then move along; nothing to see here. :)*</p>

<p><em>**Ed. Note 2:</em>* This isn&#39;t a &quot;new years resolution&quot; post. It&#39;s an &quot;I waited way too effing long to do this stuff already&quot; post.*</p>

<p><em>**Ed. Note 3:</em>* I&#39;m clearly my own editor.*</p>

<p>I had an epiphany in the middle of the night last night. I realized two things simultaneously: </p>

<ol>
<li> I suck at taking care of myself in lots of ways, and </li>
<li>in that regard, I&#39;m very good at tricking myself by letting things become excuses.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some ways in which I&#39;m guilty of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t sleep enough. </li>
<li>I don&#39;t eat well at all (or eat well enough regularly enough). </li>
<li>I let tasks pile up. Not work things or big things, but little things. Laundry, returning a package, cleaning my room, buying supplies.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t even get me started on exercise. </li>
<li>I let work fill in the cracks of my life because I feel responsible or it&#39;s necessary or it feels good/rewarding.</li>
</ul>

<p>But overall, there was one major theme: <strong>instead of making time to keep myself healthy and take care of myself, I&#39;ve been letting the bullshit of being &quot;busy&quot; take away too much from some important things</strong>. Generally, I havent&#39; been respecting the time it takes to do these important things, and as a result have been trying to minimize them or shortcut them.</p>

<p>So I decided to knock it off. Cold turkey. I&#39;m not phasing it in, because I&#39;ve let &quot;busy&quot; distract me from the things I need to do for so long. I&#39;m just doing it, and I&#39;m going to do my best to stop making excuses not to do these things, because there is no excuse not to take better care of myself.</p>

<h3>So, What am I Going to Do About It?</h3>

<h4>For Starters:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quit Nutrisystem</strong>. Wait, what? This sounds counter-intuitive, I know. I&#39;ve lost some weight on nutrisystem. But its&#39; is full of sodium, processed, etc. etc. Most importantly in my situation, it became a crutch. I&#39;d cram a bunch of Nutrisystem because I didn&#39;t have time. I&#39;d stop buying fresh food and subsist on their food which is only half of what they tell you to do anyway. So I consumed too much of their food. The effect started reversing itself. And honestly, it just didn&#39;t feel natural. The combination of my methods and the food made me feel like I was eating food for machines. I want to eat food for people, because I want to be more of a person.</li>
<li><strong>Not rushing to work and instead prepping for my day</strong>. I get to work earlier than most people every day anyway. But I wake up, rush, neglect breakfast, taking time to center myself, relaxing, etc. I love the morning, but I don&#39;t appreciate it nearly enough.</li>
<li><strong>Replace my after-work Starbucks trip with an after-work trip to Giant</strong>. They&#39;re in the same damn parking lot, and yet I&#39;ve been neglecting healthy food for its short-term energy supplement.</li>
<li><strong>Buy fresher things</strong>. One technique I&#39;m using is to attempt to spend all my time at Giant in the fresh food sections. If I don&#39;t stray too far from that except for items I know I need, then the stuff I discover should generally be better for me.</li>
<li><strong>Plan meals better, and plan them for leftovers</strong>. I&#39;m one dude. I need better organization for the food I make. I suck at this now, but it&#39;ll be a good challenge. For starters, I&#39;ll attempt to be packing a lunch before work every day.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 30 minutes a day</strong>. A bare-minimum requirement, but one I haven&#39;t been meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Drink more water</strong>. I received a nice water vessel  for Christmas, yet I haven&#39;t used it. Ridiculous. It&#39;s 70% of my body but I&#39;ve been drinking coffee like it&#39;s water. Only water is water.</li>
<li><strong>Take vitamins</strong>. It&#39;s easy as hell to take a vitamin a day.</li>
</ul>

<h4>But most importantly:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hold myself to these things as publicly as possible</strong>. You&#39;ll be seeing more blog posts like these, with different themes. I hope you&#39;ll indulge me and feel free to comment if you see fit. Be critical, encourage me to do better things. See a better choice I could have made? Add your thoughts. I can fool myself, but I can&#39;t fool you smart people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, now that that&#39;s all out in the open, let&#39;s start this adventure, shall we?</p>
