<p><em>Ed. Note: This is a post category I’m trying to start, as a form of public disclosure, listing items I bought at the grocery store, available publicly for your reference or critique.</em></p>

<p>Alright, since this is the first one of these, I haven’t quite figured out how I’m going to do it all the time. I’ll likely scan my lists, but for now, I’ll list the items.</p>

<p>I think this is an okay start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A green pepper &amp; a yellow pepper</li>
  <li>Sliced baby bella mushrooms (I’m lazy, sue me)</li>
  <li>6  apples </li>
  <li>Dozen eggs</li>
  <li>An onion</li>
  <li>A tomato</li>
  <li>1/2 Gallon Fat-Free Milk</li>
  <li>Crumbled Feta cheese</li>
  <li>Boatland Farms Strawberry / Banana Juice</li>
  <li>Celery Sticks</li>
  <li>Asparagus</li>
  <li>A Cucumber</li>
  <li>Garlic</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="my-plan">My Plan</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Apples for Snacks</li>
  <li>Tonight: Orzo (package some up for lunch tomorrow with an apple, celery sticks, &amp; sliced pepper to snack on throughout the day)</li>
  <li>Tomorrow morning: Eggs and leftover tomato &amp; onion with garlic</li>
  <li>Tomorrow evening: Asparagus and mushrooms with chicken &amp; garlic (with planned leftovers for lunch)</li>
  <li>Glass of milk each morning</li>
</ul>

<p>This is mainly my “keeping me honest” thing, but your thoughts &amp; suggestions are always welcome in the comments.</p>
