<p>I just thought it up – taken from an e-mail response I just wrote to Al Franken:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They would protect an stagnant industry that wants to pour its own cement shoes while complaining that the water is rising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it brings home what the industry is doing to itself. By refusing to evolve and instead fighting innovation under the guise of lost profits (the battle over the VCR, anyone?), helping the industry with legislation is stopping it from helping itself.</p>

<p>Am I completely off base? Do you agree? I’d love to hear in the comments.</p>
