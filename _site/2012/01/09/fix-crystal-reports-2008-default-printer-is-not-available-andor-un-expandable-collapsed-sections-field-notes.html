<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>In Crystal Reports 2008, when opening up a report that came from elsewhere (usually another user’s machine), I see: 
&gt; default printer is not available.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, this will be accompanied by a strange behavior that will cause reports (or subreports) to look completely collapsed, like the following image:</p>

<p>“Oh”, you say to yourself, “I’ll just expand those sections manually and carry on.” Well <em>think again, renegade</em> – Crystal Reports will have <em>none</em> of it. The sections appear frozen in place forever.</p>

<p>Your report sections. It <em>is</em> as painful as it looks.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Luckily, per usual, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8714797/crystal-reports-2008-sections-are-collapsed-and-i-cant-expand">StackOverflow was a big help here</a>.</p>

<p>This solution has two different parts – you may only need one or the other, but I’ve found them both to be a pretty effective one-two punch in this situation.</p>

<h4 id="part-1-change-your-printer-settings">Part 1: Change Your Printer Settings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>While in the report, click <code>File &gt; Page Setup...</code></li>
  <li>Check the box labeled <code>No Printer (optimize for screen display)</code>.</li>
  <li>Check the box labeled <code>Dissociate formatting page size and Printer Paper Size</code>.</li>
  <li>The box should look like below:</li>
</ul>

That should do it.</p>

<h4 id="part-2-change-display-options">Part 2: Change Display Options</h4>
<p>In case you have some sub-reports, etc. that didn’t quite get the message to <em>thaw out, bro</em>, it’s likely because they were hidden before or hidden as a result of the printer situation being screwy.</p>

<p>Try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While in the report, click <code>File&gt;  Options...</code></li>
  <li>Click the <code>Layout</code> tab (usually visible by default in my experience)</li>
  <li>In the <code>Design View</code> section, check the “Show hidden sections” option. This will cause any unwieldy sections to fall in line and become visible.</li>
</ul>
