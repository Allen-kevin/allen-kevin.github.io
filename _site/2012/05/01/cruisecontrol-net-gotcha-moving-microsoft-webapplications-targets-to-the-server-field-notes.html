<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>When attempting an automated build, CruiseControl.NET (running on Server 2008 R2 with .NET Framework 4.0 Installed) gives the following error in its log:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error MSB4019: The imported project “C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets” was not found. Confirm that the path in the <code>&lt;Import&gt;</code> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>This is ridiculous, but you have to copy the two files from your machine to the Build Server.</p>

<p>Copy the directory <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\*.*</code> to the same location on the build server. </p>
