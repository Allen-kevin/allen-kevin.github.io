<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>I added a table in Excel 2010 and now I need to get rid of the table aspect and make them normal cells again.</p>

<p>Just changing the formatting to “Normal” doesn’t remove the programmatic features of table formatting (I can still sort my data as a table, etc. which I don’t want to be able to do.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>This is called “converting to a range.” to convert a table back to a range:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight the table in your spreadsheet</li>
  <li>The <code>Design</code> tab will appear on the ribbon menu. Click it to enter the design section.</li>
  <li>In the design section, click the <code>Convert to Range</code> button.</li>
  <li>Excel will ask you if you’re sure. Click Yes.</li>
  <li>The range will be converted to normal cells.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
