<p>Steps to attempt to pay for / download / install Eidos’ Hitman 2: Silent assassin:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to Eidos.com</li>
  <li>Click “Store”</li>
  <li>Search for “hitman”. Note the game pops up. Note that the price is in Pounds, not dollars).</li>
  <li>Attempt to buy. Receive a message saying you’re out of the service area for this download. Note that the browser is now pointing to a .co.uk domain (strange, since you entered Eidos.com)</li>
  <li>Go back to Eidos.com realize that for some reason it thinks you’re British and click on the “USA” link to switch the locale.</li>
  <li>Note that the “Store” icon is greyed out completely, with no explanation whatsoever. Clicking on it does nothing.</li>
  <li>Frustrated, realize that it must be because you don’t have an Eidos.com login. That’s cool, you’re happy to create one.</li>
  <li>Click “Register”. You are taken to a simple-enough registration page. </li>
  <li>Enter your name (no spaces) as your username, enter your correct e-mail, enter a password of letters &amp; numbers (9+ characters), date of birth, be sure to select the right options.</li>
  <li>Receive an error: “Sorry, the Eidos Connect account could not be created because of the following error(s): Profile is invalid”</li>
  <li>Think maybe it’s because you entered something wrong. Enter the information again. </li>
  <li>Receive the same error.</li>
  <li>Enter the information again including all optional fields.</li>
  <li>Receive the same error again, with still no indication of anything you could have done wrong.</li>
  <li>Realize that you’re using Google Chrome and maybe it doesn’t support that browser.</li>
  <li>Retry steps 8-14 in Internet Explorer. Receive the same error.</li>
  <li>Retry steps 8-14 in Firefox. Receive the same error.</li>
  <li>Give up, having wasted 30 minutes of your life just to attempt o give Eidos your money.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just wanted to map that out for you in case software companies wonder why someone could ever consider pirating a game. PLEASE HELP ME GIVE YOU MY MONEY.</p>

<p>Unless maybe, the Eidos web site is a game itself?! If you’re able to figure out the cypher across the ruins of post-apocalyptic webpage design, and complete the mighty download against the wishes of the enraged server gods, you too can give your money to Eidos! Definitely a new idea. I want the rights to that one.</p>

<p>…I know I’m being harsh here, but I think you need to know that I’m not often a gamer – but I AM an IT guy – and in anticipation of Hitman 3 I wanted to delve into the series for the first time. This was my first interaction with you as a customer, and likely my last.</p>

<p>By contrast: I wanted to play call of duty. I went to valve’s web site, searched, clicked download, set up an account, paid, kicked off the download and was playing 20 minutes later.</p>
