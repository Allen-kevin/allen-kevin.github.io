<p>Steps to attempt to pay for / download / install Eidos&#39; Hitman 2: Silent assassin:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to Eidos.com</li>
<li>Click &quot;Store&quot;</li>
<li>Search for &quot;hitman&quot;. Note the game pops up. Note that the price is in Pounds, not dollars).</li>
<li>Attempt to buy. Receive a message saying you&#39;re out of the service area for this download. Note that the browser is now pointing to a .co.uk domain (strange, since you entered Eidos.com)</li>
<li>Go back to Eidos.com realize that for some reason it thinks you&#39;re British and click on the &quot;USA&quot; link to switch the locale.</li>
<li>Note that the &quot;Store&quot; icon is greyed out completely, with no explanation whatsoever. Clicking on it does nothing.</li>
<li>Frustrated, realize that it must be because you don&#39;t have an Eidos.com login. That&#39;s cool, you&#39;re happy to create one.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Register&quot;. You are taken to a simple-enough registration page. </li>
<li>Enter your name (no spaces) as your username, enter your correct e-mail, enter a password of letters &amp; numbers (9+ characters), date of birth, be sure to select the right options.</li>
<li>Receive an error: &quot;Sorry, the Eidos Connect account could not be created because of the following error(s): Profile is invalid&quot;</li>
<li>Think maybe it&#39;s because you entered something wrong. Enter the information again. </li>
<li>Receive the same error.</li>
<li>Enter the information again including all optional fields.</li>
<li>Receive the same error again, with still no indication of anything you could have done wrong.</li>
<li>Realize that you&#39;re using Google Chrome and maybe it doesn&#39;t support that browser.</li>
<li>Retry steps 8-14 in Internet Explorer. Receive the same error.</li>
<li>Retry steps 8-14 in Firefox. Receive the same error.</li>
<li>Give up, having wasted 30 minutes of your life just to attempt o give Eidos your money.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just wanted to map that out for you in case software companies wonder why someone could ever consider pirating a game. PLEASE HELP ME GIVE YOU MY MONEY.</p>

<p>Unless maybe, the Eidos web site is a game itself?! If you&#39;re able to figure out the cypher across the ruins of post-apocalyptic webpage design, and complete the mighty download against the wishes of the enraged server gods, you too can give your money to Eidos! Definitely a new idea. I want the rights to that one.</p>

<p>...I know I&#39;m being harsh here, but I think you need to know that I&#39;m not often a gamer -- but I AM an IT guy -- and in anticipation of Hitman 3 I wanted to delve into the series for the first time. This was my first interaction with you as a customer, and likely my last.</p>

<p>By contrast: I wanted to play call of duty. I went to valve&#39;s web site, searched, clicked download, set up an account, paid, kicked off the download and was playing 20 minutes later.</p>
