<p>I am currently running the following setup on my beast of a desktop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VirtualBox x64</li>
  <li>Two VMs of XenServer, each with 8 GB of RAM</li>
  <li>A guest OS of CentOS Desktop, one on each of the XenServers</li>
  <li>A VM of CloudStack via VirtualBox with 4GB of RAM, managing the XenServer servers</li>
  <li>Using XenCenter directly from the Desktop as another means of Managing the XenServers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pretty sure that’s the beginning of a cloud right there, without ever having to leave 127.0.0.1.</p>
