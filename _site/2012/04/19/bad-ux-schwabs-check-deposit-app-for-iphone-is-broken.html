	<div class="post"><p><em>**Ed. Note:</em>* I wrote this when I was quite annoyed, and unfortunately I left out the larger context that this is actually one of the best checking accounts I&#39;ve ever owned. It&#39;s free, you gain interest, and all ATM fees get refunded at the end of the month.*</p>

<p><em>Also, in the interest of Schwab, who I (rightfully) criticize here, they also reached out to me personally and I have a direct line of contact to help them fix this bug if I&#39;m able to reproduce it in the future. Pretty good social media response.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Just an FYI -- if you&#39;re considering Schwab because of their touted mobile phone check deposit system, might want to think again if you have an iPhone.</p>

<p>On my iPhone 4S, here is the experience I just had trying to deposit a check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the app</li>
<li>Login to the app using my <a href="http://skwordpresstoghost.azurewebsites.net/?p=1201">poor-by-mandate password</a></li>
<li>Select Schwab Bank account, even though my Schwab investor account is inactive (an extra unnecessary click)</li>
<li>Click <code>Deposit Check</code></li>
<li>Enter the amount of the check</li>
<li>Click the button to take a picture of the front of the check</li>
<li>line the check up with the blue box on the screen and then hit the camera button.</li>
<li>See a preview image of the front of the check. But wait, it&#39;s not the cropped version inside the blue box, but instead it&#39;s the whole picture, which looks much smaller and off-center.</li>
<li>Hit the <code>Use Image</code> button. Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Wait, anticipating something to happen (i.e. data transfer). Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Hit <code>Cancel</code> button. Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Hit <code>Cancel</code> again. Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Hit <code>Retake Image</code> button. Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Hit buttons many times hoping for something to happen. Nothing happens.</li>
<li>Hope there&#39;s a back button. There is none.</li>
<li>Hit the Home button and then force-quit the app from the app tray, just to be sure.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat steps 1-14</strong>, which ends in utter frustration.</li>
<li>This time, try switching away from the app and switching back (instead of quitting)</li>
<li><strong>Repeat steps 1-14</strong>, with no success.</li>
<li>Force quit the app again.</li>
<li>This time, <strong>repeat steps 1-14</strong> ignoring the blue box (thinking that the bug is maybe that it&#39;s expecting the whole picture to be the check). No success there either.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat steps 1-14</strong>, attempting to scan the back of the check first, even though it&#39;s the second button.</li>
<li>IT WORKED!</li>
<li>Click the button for the front of the check. it worked!</li>
<li>Hit Review deposit</li>
<li>Hit submit deposit.</li>
</ul>

<p>26 Steps. But really, when you account for the fact that I was repeating sections of steps,<strong>I had to take around 78 steps just to do something as &quot;intuitive&quot; as submitting a check</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve figured out a way around their UX madness, I hope to be able to submit this to their support accounts and hopefully get some results.</p>

<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
