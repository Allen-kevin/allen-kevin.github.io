<p>My desktop PC has 32 GB of RAM. It’s ridiculous in that way, by almost any standard. I assumed that when I hit full usage of memory it would be because my entire virtual network of random servers, etc. would be running at once.</p>

<p>I was wrong. All it took was running Chkdsk.exe on an external HDD.</p>

<p>See below for yourself:</p>

<p>In case you can’t see it clearly, that’s Chkdsk.exe taking up 30,060,916 KB of RAM. Otherwise known as <strong><em>30.06 GB of RAM</em></strong>.</p>

<p><a href="">Apparently</a> <a href="">this</a> <a href="">has</a> <a href="">been</a> a <a href="">known</a> <a href="">issue</a> <a href="">for</a> a <a href="">long</a> <a href="">time</a>.</p>

<p>If I find a resolution, I’ll post one here in problem/solution format. If you have any tips, drop a line in the comments!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently the OS shipped with this bug and there’s no attempt to correct it as it’s a very low-level architecture issue. I’ll check Windows 8 in a VM and see if it runs into the same problem.</p>
