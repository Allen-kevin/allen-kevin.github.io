<p>I can’t believe I hadn’t heard of this before. There’s a neat tool that ships with Windows 7 called the “Problem Steps Recorder” tool (psr.exe)</p>

<h4 id="the-process-works-like-this">The Process Works Like This:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A user clicks the record button</li>
  <li>The user performs all the steps to recreate the problem (and can add comments at each step)</li>
  <li>The user clicks stop recording, and is prompted to save a ZIP file, which they can then mail to a technician.</li>
  <li>The ZIP file contains an MHT file.</li>
  <li>This file contains a screenshot of every step the user performs, as well as system information regarding those steps. You can look through them one-by-one or play them as a slide show.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="to-access-the-tool">To Access the Tool</h4>
<p>From a windows 7 machine, in the Start menu, type <code>psr</code> and click <code>PSR.exe</code>. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: if you have applications running in Administrator mode, you will need to run PSR.exe in administrator mode in order to be allowed to capture those.</p>
