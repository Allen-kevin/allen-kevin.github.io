<p>A quick note for myself an anyone else who might be interested:</p>

<p>Maximo 7 has a few internal status codes, but custom statuses can easily be created. However, these have to map to one of the internal status codes.</p>

<p>I wanted to give our customers an overview of the internal status codes and their mappings. After some searching, I found the following method successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Login to Maximo 7</li>
  <li>Click <code>Go To &gt; System Configuration &gt; Platform Configuration &gt; Domains</code></li>
  <li>Search for the <code>WOSTATUS</code> domain and expand it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, youâ€™ll have a list of all statuses with internal and external values.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
