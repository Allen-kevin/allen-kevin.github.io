For anyone who has had an issue with a GMail 707 error in the browser recently, a [potentially useful tip](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/11/gmail-707-error.html) via Brad Feld over at [FeldThoughts](http://www.feld.com/wp/):

>The answer was a simple one once I figured it out. I disabled all the Google Labs and it magically started working again. I then re-enabled Labs until I found the one that was causing the 707 error – the “Background Send” Labs. Apparently something broke over the weekend with Background Send and the newest browser version of Gmail.

>If you are getting a 707 error, just turn off Background Send. That should fix it.

Thought it might be useful to some.
