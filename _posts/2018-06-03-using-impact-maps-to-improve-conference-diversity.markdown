I've been seeing and having a lot of conversations lately around diversity in conference line-ups. A hugely interesting facet of this for me was hearing a lot of the rationale from conference organizers about why they didn't have a diverse line-up. I heard a lot of comments along the lines of:

* "It's not our fault that women don't submit to our CFP"
* "It's really hard when someone gets angry at you because you asked them to be a woman speaker"
* "I really care about this problem but I just don't know what else to do."
* "I'm only one person, how could I possibly try to accomplish this?"
* "I feel like I've tried everything and nothing is making a difference".

Oooof. We'll unpack a lot of these statements later. But suffice it to say, we can all do better.

As an industry, many folks would like to improve this, but aren't sure how to get there.

**This is a great opportunity for an impact map**. In this post, we'll explore this problem using one of my favorite tools.

## A Note Before I begin

I'm a cisgender, heterosexual white guy -- and as such the recipient of an embarrassing amount of societal privilege. I'm writing this because I haven't seen it anywhere else and it seems like it could help. I don't by any means see this as the only solution to a hard problem. If my privilege shows anywhere in this article, let me know -- I welcome the conversation. Do you have something to add that I missed? Let me know; I'm always up to expand the list below.

Also, let me say this -- conference planning is *hard*. I know a lot of people who've organized conferences, and I believe most are passionate about this topic and would love to see more diversity amongst speakers. I don't mean to be armchair quarterbacking here, and this isn't some indictment of all conference organizers, or a quick &amp; easy solution.

## What is Impact Mapping?

Before we dive into the meat of the article, I want to give a quick elevator pitch for impact mapping. I'm new to this myself, but I recommend [ImpactMapping.org](https://www.impactmapping.org/about.html) or [my colleague Mathias's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9ucDwbh04&list=WL&index=79&t=1120s) for a much deeper dive than I can provide here. Both resources are worth checking out.

Impact maps aim to solve the problem of "feature factories", where companies are taking actions or producing products without regard for what real tangible value those products are providing for those who are affected by it.

In order to ensure that we're tackling something that's important to the business, an impact map generally has four parts:

* **Goal**: What we want to achieve. Usually specific, measurable, and time-boxed, e.g. "Increase users 20% in the next 6 months".
* **Who**: Who can help us achieve the aforementioned goal? What groups could change their behavior in some way to help us achieve this goal?
* **How**: How could the aforementioned person or group change their behavior to help us reach the goal?
* **What**: What can we do to influence them to change their behavior in this way

## Why do I love impact mapping? 

There are a number of reasons to love impact mapping:

* **It forces us to think about personas**. All too often, the "who" step is glossed over, or replaced with some generic notion of "users". This limits our ability to empathize and step into others' shoes. Impact maps force us to take more specific personas into account when problem solving.
* **It helps surface a wider array of options**. Impact maps support "divergent thinking" -- searching for many paths to a solution instead of trying to find the perfect one. So many times, features or actions come from someone saying "I know -- let's do x/y/z" with little follow-up as to whether we got closer to the goal. An impact map opens this up, democratizing the discussion and allowing other avenues for exploration. We end up with a lot more things we can try to get to the right place.
* **It frames actions as experiments**. Impact maps have two levels of experiments. At the more specific level, we are able to assess whether the actions we've taken -- the "what" -- have influenced the persona to actually change their behavior in the way we wanted. And at a broader level, we can assess whether influencing those personas to change their behavior has actually moved us closer to the goal.

## Applying Impact Maps to the Problem of Conference Speaker Diversity

If a goal is to improve diversity in conference speakers (and IMO it should be a goal!), then there are a few groups / personas we could consider as part of the impact map.

There are the groups involved in planning:

* Organizers
* Sponsors
* Selection committee members

And there are also various types of underrepresented speakers we'd like to influence to submit their talks:

* Women
* POC
* LGBTQIA+ speakers
* People who don't feel safe in conference spaces
* People who are disabled
* Moms
* People with financial barriers
* People with time barriers
* Those who have [imposter syndrome](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-impostor-syndrome/)

## What does this tell Us?

* **Attracting diverse speakers is more than a CFP**.
* **This is going to take work**.
