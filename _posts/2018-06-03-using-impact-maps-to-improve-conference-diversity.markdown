I've been seeing and having a lot of conversations lately around diversity in conference line-ups (read: ensuring a diverse group of attendees and speakers). But more interesting was hearing a lot of the rationale from conference organizers about why they didn't have a diverse line-up. I heard a lot of comments along the lines of:

* "It's not our fault that women don't submit to our CFP"
* "It's really hard when someone gets angry at you because you asked them to be a woman speaker"
* "I really care about this problem but I just don't know what else to do."
* "I'm only one person, how could I possibly try to accomplish this?"
* "I feel like I'm trying everything and nothing is having an impact".

Oooof. We'll unpack a lot of these statements later. But suffice it to say, we can all do better.

As an industry, many folks would like to improve this, but aren't sure how to get there.

**This is a great opportunity for an impact map**. In this post, we'll explore this problem using one of my favorite tools. 

## What is Impact Mapping?

Before we dive into the meat of the article, I want to give a quick elevator pitch for impact mapping. I'm new to this myself, but I recommend [ImpactMapping.org](https://www.impactmapping.org/about.html) or [my colleague Mathias's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9ucDwbh04&list=WL&index=79&t=1120s) for a much deeper dive than I can provide here.



* **Goal**: What we want to achieve. Usually specific, measurable, and time-boxed, e.g. "Increase users 20% in the next 6 months".
* **Who**: Who can help us achieve the aforementioned goal? What groups could change their behavior in some way to help us achieve this goal?
* **How**: How could the aforementioned person or group change their behavior to help us reach the goal?
* **What**: What can we do to influence them to change their behavior in this way

## Why do I love impact mapping? 

There are a number of reasons to love impact mapping:

* **It forces us to think about personas**.
* **It helps with divergent thinking**. 
* **It frames things as experiments**.
