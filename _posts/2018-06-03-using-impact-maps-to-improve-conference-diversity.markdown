I've been seeing and having a lot of conversations lately around diversity in conference line-ups. An interesting facet of this for me was hearing a lot of the rationale from conference organizers about why they didn't have a diverse line-up. I heard a lot of comments along the lines of:

* "It's not our fault that women don't submit to our CFP"
* "It's really hard when someone gets angry at you because you asked them to be a woman speaker"
* "I really care about this problem but I just don't know what else to do."
* "I'm only one person, how could I possibly try to accomplish this?"
* "I feel like I've tried everything and nothing is making a difference".

Oooof. We'll unpack a lot of these statements later. But suffice it to say, we can all do better -- and I believe many conference organizers genuinely want to do better.

As an industry, many folks would like to improve this, but aren't sure how to get there.

**This is a great opportunity for an impact map**. In this post, we'll explore this problem using one of my favorite tools.

## A Note Before I begin

If you're expecting an argument on whether more diversity is truly needed in conference line-ups, this won't be the article for you. That part isn't up for debate here. We need more diversity of thought in many places in tech, and conferences are one of the most visible arenas where we can improve that.

I'm a cisgender, heterosexual white guy -- and as such the recipient of an embarrassing amount of societal privilege. I'm writing this because I haven't seen it anywhere else and it seems like it could help. I don't by any means see this as the only solution to a hard problem. If my privilege shows anywhere in this article, let me know -- I welcome the conversation. Do you have something to add that I missed? Let me know; I'm always up to expand the list below.

One place I know I'm falling short on right at the outset, which I'll be working to correct, is my understanding of the needs of underrepresented racial / ethnic groups. Prior to writing this article, I would have told you that I thought I empathized with that group well enough. But if I couldn't come up with a unique way to specifically support POC in a conference setting, I've got some major work to do. Which I'm getting to work on right after I write this up; expect updates.

Also, let me say this -- conference planning is *hard*. I know a lot of people who've organized conferences, and I believe most are passionate about this topic and would love to see more diversity amongst speakers. I don't mean to be armchair quarterbacking here, and this isn't some indictment of all conference organizers, or a quick &amp; easy solution.

## What is Impact Mapping?

Before we dive into the meat of the article, I want to give a quick elevator pitch for impact mapping. I'm new to this myself, but I recommend [ImpactMapping.org](https://www.impactmapping.org/about.html) or [my colleague Mathias's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9ucDwbh04&list=WL&index=79&t=1120s) for a much deeper dive than I can provide here. Both resources are worth checking out.

Impact maps aim to solve the problem of "feature factories", where companies are taking actions or producing products without regard for what real tangible value those products are providing for those who are affected by it.

In order to ensure that we're tackling something that's important to the business, an impact map generally has four parts:

* **Goal**: What we want to achieve. Usually specific, measurable, and time-boxed, e.g. "Increase users 20% in the next 6 months".
* **Who**: Who can help us achieve the aforementioned goal? What groups could change their behavior in some way to help us achieve this goal?
* **How**: How could the aforementioned person or group change their behavior to help us reach the goal?
* **What**: What can we do to influence them to change their behavior in this way

## Why do I love impact mapping? 

There are a number of reasons to love impact mapping:

* **It forces us to think about personas**. All too often, the "who" step is glossed over, or replaced with some generic notion of "users". This limits our ability to empathize and step into others' shoes. Impact maps force us to take more specific personas into account when problem solving.
* **It helps surface a wider array of options**. Impact maps support "divergent thinking" -- searching for many paths to a solution instead of trying to find the perfect one. So many times, features or actions come from someone saying "I know -- let's do x/y/z" with little follow-up as to whether we got closer to the goal. An impact map opens this up, democratizing the discussion and allowing other avenues for exploration. We end up with a lot more things we can try to get to the right place.
* **It frames actions as experiments**. Impact maps have two levels of experiments. At the more specific level, we are able to assess whether the actions we've taken -- the "what" -- have influenced the persona to actually change their behavior in the way we wanted. And at a broader level, we can assess whether influencing those personas to change their behavior has actually moved us closer to the goal.

These pieces of impact mapping seem like they could assist in the problem of conference speaker diversity. In order to produce real change and encourage broader participation, we need to think about each of these groups and their potentially unique needs or motivators. And we need to think in terms of many options, not trying one or two things and then calling it a day if our limited set of ideas didn't work.

## Applying Impact Maps to the Problem of Conference Speaker Diversity

If a goal is to improve diversity in conference speakers (and IMO it should be a goal!), then there are a few groups / personas we could consider as part of the impact map.

There are the groups involved in planning &amp; running conferences, who we might want to modify their behavior in various ways:

* Organizers
* Sponsors
* Selection committee members
* Event Promoters
* Advertisers

And there are also various types of underrepresented speakers we'd like to influence specifically to submit their talks:

* Women
* POC
* LGBTQIA+ speakers
* People who don't feel safe in conference spaces
* People who are disabled
* Moms
* People with financial barriers
* People with time barriers
* Those who have [imposter syndrome](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-impostor-syndrome/)

These groups may overlap -- that's OK, lots of personas do. There's no reason we can't repeat items or tailor things specifically to a certain underrepresented group.

## Impact map: The speaker personas

TODO: Attempt to format the impact map in some way for the screen. A table? A lot of headings? Long-indented bulleted list?

## What does this tell Us?

* **Impact maps can flip our understanding.** Rather than conferences being a place with a uniform CFP that then everyone should submit to, we see groups of underrepresented speakers as stakeholders that we can hope to influence to speak. That's a very different power dynamic, and one that would likely benefit a conference's speaker demographics.
* **Attracting diverse speakers is more than a CFP**. It's about creating an environment where underrepresented speakers -- and those like them -- feel that they can thrive, contribute, and have their values respected & recognized .
* **This is going to take work**. Conference organizing is hard work, and I'm grateful to those who continually put themselves out there for the community's benefit. But if we want to show we can truly be inclusive.

## What's next?

Now that I've articulated some of these thoughts, I'm hoping to receive feedback from the community -- especially additions and corrections.

Once we have a list of ways we can help underrepresented speakers & attendees feel welcomed and encouraged, I think this list could spawn a nice reference site or toolbox for conference organizers to remove some of the cognitive load and make it easier to do the things that make a conference stand out as being welcoming for underrepresented groups.

## I'd love to hear from you!

What did I get wrong here? What am I missing? What could I improve? Where should this go next?

I welcome your comments and hope to tweak this a bunch in the coming days with your feedback.
