Subject says it all.

I was looking for the IBM Maximo 7.1 User's Guide (as there appeared to be one for 6.2.1) and I was having a lot of difficulty finding it, until I found this little ditty on [an IBM Resources page](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/maximo/Related+Resources):

>Looking for the Maximo Asset Management 7.1 User's Guide? It is replaced with the Product Reference Guide.

So there you have it. If you'd like the direct link, [you can find the User Guide / Product Reference Guide here][Max User Guide].
