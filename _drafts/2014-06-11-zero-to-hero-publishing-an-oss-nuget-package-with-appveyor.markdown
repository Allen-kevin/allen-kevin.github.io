title: 'Zero to Hero: Publishing an OSS Nuget package with AppVeyor'

[The Zero to Hero series is where I try to provide a complete solution from scratch. Better series titles are encouraged; feel free to suggest one.]

I've been starting a nifty little open source project called Sieve .NET. It aims to do one small thing well -- filtering that provides expression support to be passed into ORMs and the like -- because I haven't been able to find anything else that does it better yet.
