title: 'Quick Tip: Accidentally Bricked Evernote? Here''s how to get a clean re-sync'
---
###Problem
I accidentally pasted a bunch of useless content into an Evernote note. Unfortunately, that content caused Evernote to crash, as well as crashing every time Evernote tried to start after that.
###Solution
**NOTE**: you'll lose any other local data that hadnt been synced yet. There's no warranty on this solution.

* First, try: submit bug report to Evernote. Didn't work well (they may not have received it.)

If that doesn't work: 

* delete `appdata -> local -> Evernote -> databases -> [NameOfYourEvernoteDB].exb`
* start Evernote
* enter password

At this point, re-sync will begin.
