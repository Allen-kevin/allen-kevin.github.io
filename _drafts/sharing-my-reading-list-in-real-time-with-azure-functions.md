I've been a fan of RSS feeds for a long time. I love curating a collection of knowledge that streams to me at my pace, and I consider feeds to be a fundamental piece of how I keep up with technology and stay fresh. I currently use [Feedly])(http://feedly.com) and have been a happy pro user for years.

But something is missing. As much as I like reading, I also like sharing. 

## The Requirements

* Only show my development-related feeds
* Can continuously run with minimal intervention
* Cost-effective

## The Ingredients

* Feedly API
* Azure Functions

## Getting Started

* Set up a functions account
* Get a Feedly API key

## Setting up a function to refresh the auth key

## Setting up a function to extract the OPML

## Getting the OPML file into my blog as a link
