title: Lessons Learned from my Transition To Ghost
---
* Writing in Markdown is so much more natural.
* Ghost has shortcuts! `CTRL + B` wraps your text in the markdown equivalent of bold.
* There is **so much crap** in my old formatting.
* Consistency is beautiful.
* The ghost transition process I described **removes all backslashes**. There will probably be pieces of code, etc. that are screwed up as a result.
* My old blog editor made me lazy.
 * Too hard to do multi-level lists? Put a bunch of text in parentheses!
 * Need to clarify a point? Forget footnotes, just put some text afterwards in a bracket.
* I have more writing than I thought.
* Is what I write actually worth it?
* Going forward, having things in markdown should make them MUCH easier to transfer elsewhere.
* Images are going to be **large** on here for a little bit.
* It feels good to be free. For too long, I've depended on a service instead of doing it myself. I'm a web developer for pete's sake.
* Some of my stuff does not deserve to stay out there. it had old or wrong information, concepts I wasn't familiar with that the time. It doesn't contribute to the discourse. I was conflicted about whether to have these remain for history or to remove them. Since they don't contribute to the larger discourse, I chose to remove them.
* No one can take this away from me (e.g. Google and the G+ monster).
