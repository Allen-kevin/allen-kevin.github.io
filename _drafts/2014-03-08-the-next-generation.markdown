So, if you visit this web site, you have have noticed a slight change recently: **We're now on the http://www.ghost.com blogging platform, running on Windows Azure!**

I'm very excited about this change. I expect things to get a lot cleaner, more manageable, and for the overall experience to be better for users.

###How did we get here?
I owe quite a bit of thanks to [Elijah Manor's Post on how to migrate from Blogger to Ghost](http://www.elijahmanor.com/from-blogger-to-ghost/). 
Essentially, the process boiled down to:

* Exporting my blogger posts in their Atom format
* Creating a temporary WordPress blog on Azure and importing posts into that
* Installing the [Ghost export plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/installation/) and exporting posts
* Importing the posts into Ghost
* Installing and configuring the Disqus plugin for ghost
* Importing older comments via Disqus
* Changing the theme
 * Note: [This Link](http://cyanbyfuchsia.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/changing-ghost-theme-and-add-disqus-comment/) is helpful.
* Code Syntax highlighting
 * Note: [This link](http://cyanbyfuchsia.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/add-code-syntax-highlighting-to-your-ghost-blogging-site/) is helpful
* **...and quite a bit of cleanup to remove the old cruft on posts.**
